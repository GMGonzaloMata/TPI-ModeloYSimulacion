# **App Name**: ParkSim UCP

## Core Features:

- Arrival Simulation: Simulate vehicle arrivals using exponential distributions based on time of day (morning, peak, afternoon).
- Parking Duration Simulation: Simulate parking duration using a normal distribution.
- Space Allocation: Implement parking space allocation logic, prioritizing reserved spaces and handling rejections when full.
- Real-Time Visualization: Display a visual representation of the parking layout with real-time updates on space availability (internal, external, projected).
- Parameter Control: Provide controls (sliders, inputs) to adjust simulation parameters such as arrival rates and parking durations.
- Dynamic Statistics: Display dynamic statistics, including occupancy rates, rejection rates, and average parking time.
- Number generation: Generate pseudo-random numbers using libraries like seedrandom or random-js.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent technology and efficiency, evoking a sense of calm and reliability, aligning with the controlled simulation environment. (HSL 196, 73, 52)
- Background color: A light gray (#F0F0F0) provides a clean, unobtrusive backdrop, ensuring visual clarity for the parking layout and dynamic statistics. (HSL 0, 0, 94)
- Accent color: An analogous teal (#29E2B0) used for interactive elements and highlights, drawing attention to key simulation controls and statistical data. (HSL 166, 73, 52)
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif providing a modern, machined, neutral aesthetic for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent parking zones, controls, and data points for intuitive interaction.
- A schematic map displaying the parking zones in clear layout. Utilize whitespace to differentiate elements.
- Subtle transitions and updates to the map for an engaging, informative, and responsive interface.
